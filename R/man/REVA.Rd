\title{REVA: testing whther a sclalar value differs less for coler points}
\description{
We hava a scalar value for a set of points and we have a distance between the points.
Null hypothesis: the scalar does not depend ont the location, so the values differ between distant points as strons as between close points
Main function:
}
\section{REVA functions}{

REVA.test calculates the p-value corresponding to the null
REVA.user.distance calculate distance as Kendall tau and calculate the p-value	
REVA.user.distance.Geneset does REVA.user.distance for a gene set
}
